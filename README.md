## About The Project

**ScarEncryption** provides a beautiful and powerful interface for encrypting and decrypting sensitive text directly in your browser. Built with React and modern web technologies, it ensures that your data remains completely private, as all operations are performed on the client-side. Nothing is ever sent to a server.

This project was redesigned with a modern tech stack to offer a fast, reliable, and visually stunning tool for anyone needing to quickly secure messages, notes, or any piece of text with a password.

## 🔒 Security Note

All encryption and decryption operations are performed entirely in your browser using client-side JavaScript. Your plaintext, encrypted data, and secret keys never leave your device. However, remember:

- Choose strong, unique secret keys
- This tool is for convenience, not for protecting highly sensitive data
- For maximum security, use established encryption software for critical data
